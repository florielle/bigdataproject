## Data visualization

This folder contains a mixture of Excel workbooks, Tableau workbooks, and Jupyter notebooks that we used to create our data visualizations.

#### data folder
This subfolder contains the csv files used to create the visualizations, which were created by taking the outputs of our Spark scripts. They are required to run the commands within the Jupyter notebook.
